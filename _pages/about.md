My name is Wei Liu. I am a Ph.D. student in the [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE) department at the [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/), supervised by [Prof. Melba M. Crawford](https://engineering.purdue.edu/Engr/People/ptProfile?resource_id=12521). My research interests lie in Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Vision Foundation Model, Multi-sensor Fusion, and Autonomous Driving.

**Previously**: I interned at [PlusAI](https://plus.ai/) in 2024, where I worked on the **vision foundation model for autonomous truck perception**. I obtained my master’s degree in Vehicle Engineering at [Tongji University](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/p/#/), where I worked with [Prof. Lu Xiong](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37401835800) on autonomous vehicle multi-sensor fusion for states estimation and navigation. I received my bachelor’s degree in engineering (**honors**) at [Wuhan University of Technology](http://english.whut.edu.cn/).
